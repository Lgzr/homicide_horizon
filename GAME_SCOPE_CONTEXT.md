# Homicide Horizon - Game Scope & Context

## @Eugene This channel will provide you a comprehensive breakdown of our current game-scope.

**Homicide | Murder Mystery** is a web/mobile game developed on Meta Horizon, and is a submission for the most recent Creator Contest hosted by Meta.

**Theme & Inspiration:** This is a thrilling murder mystery experience focusing on themes of immersion, realism, horror and mystery. The original Homicide game was developed on a platform called Rec Room, so this is a Horizon adaptation.

**Setting:** The game takes place in a 'haunted' Victorian mansion during an intense storm. The game starts at midnight, and the players have 7 minutes (each minute represents ~8.5 real minutes of gameplay time) to determine and eliminate the murderer, or find a way to escape. A random murderer is selected at the beginning of the round, everyone else is assigned innocent. The murderer must eliminate all players before the round ends. Innocent players must stay alive and find 5 parts to a revolver, after collecting all 5 parts, the revolver will be 'crafted' and awarded to the last player who collected the part. Players can interact and find various items throughout the game, such as batteries and bandages, keys, gold, etc.

**Core Game Loop:**

- Minimum of 1-3 players required to play (configurable, currently set to 1 for testing)
- When entering the 'start trigger' pad and minimum players is reached, the game will start
- There is a brief 15 second warm-up to each round before roles are selected
- Once the round starts, a random player is selected as the murderer and can access a knife
- 30 seconds into the round, the revolver parts spawn
- Players have 7 minutes (420 seconds) before the round ends (If murderer kills all players, murderer wins. If innocents kill murderer or craft revolver, innocents win)
